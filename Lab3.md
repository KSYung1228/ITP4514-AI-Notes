## Graph Model
 - Graph model
 - G = (V,E)
 - V is a set of vertices(nodes)
 - E is a set of edges; each edge is a pair of vertices
 - Example:
   - V = {1,2,3,4}
   - E = {(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(4,1)}

### Undirect graph
 - The edges do not have a specific direction
   - Means edges can travel in both ways
   - E.g. Facebook friend relationship

### Directed graph
 - Edges have a specific direction
   - each edge can travel in one way
   - E.g. Instagram follower relationship

## Adjacency Matrix
 - The data structure to express a graph
 - It is a [V] x [V] matrix
 - Example:
