# Lab8 Introduction to computer vision

## Computer Vision
 - computer vision is a field of artificial intelligence(AI) that enables computers and asy systems to drive meaningful information from digital images, videos and other visual inputs - and take actions or make recommendations based on that information
 - If AI enables computers to think, computer vision enables them to see, observe and understand

 1. Computers can see the world through digital images, such as photographs, live camera feeds, or recorded video files
 2. Each digital image is actually an array of numeric values indicating the color intensity of each pixel in the image. You can use these values just like any other data as feature to train a machine learning model, or to apply transformation and calculations to analyze the image data and find patterns in it
 3. A grid of numbers is overlaid on the image - each number is a value between 0 and 255, representing the intensity of each pixel
 4. In the case of color images, there  are three layers of pixel values for red, green and blue intensities.(Three overlapping tables of red, green and blue pixel values)
