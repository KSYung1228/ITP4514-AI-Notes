# Lab1 - AI: An Overview & Python Basics
## Progtamming Paradigms
 - Deckarative Programming
 - Imperative Programming

## Declarative Programming
 - focuses on desccribing the desired result or outcome of a  compuatation
 - performed to achiece that result
 - emphasizes what the program should accomplish, rather than how it should be done

## Imperative Programming
 - focuses on explicitly the sequence of steps or instructions that a computer should follow to slove a problem.
 - emphasizes how the computation should be performed, rather than solely focusing on the desied outdcome.

## AI VS Traditional Computing
 - AI: focuses on what to do -> Declarative programming.
 - Traditional Computing: focuses on how to do -> Use Imperatice programming.

## Applications of Artificial Intelligence
 - **Gaming** - AI plays crucial role in strategic games such as chess, poker, tic-tac-toe, etc., where machine can think of large number of possible poistions baed on heuristic knowledge.
 - **Natural Language Processing** - It is possible to interact with the computer that understands natural language spoken by humans.
 - **Expert Systems** - There are some applications which intergrate machine, software, and special information to impart reasonint and advising.
 - **Vision System** - These systems understand, interpret, and comprehend visual input on the computer. For example,
   - A spying eroplane takes photographs, which are used tofigutr ot map of the areas.
   - Doctors use clinical expert system to diagnose the patient.
 - **Speech Recognition** - Some intelligent systems are capable of hearing and comprehending the language in terms of sentences and their meanings while a human talks to it.
 - **Handwriting Recognition** - The handwriting recognition software reads the text written on paper by a pen or screen by a stylus. It can recognize the shapes of the letters and convert it into editable text. 
 - **Intelligent Robots** - Roots are able to perform the tasks given by a human. They have ***sensors*** to detect physical data from the real world such as light, heat, temperature, movement, sound, bump, and pressure. They have efficient ***processors***, mutiple sensors and huge memory, to exhibit intelligence. In addition, they are capable of ***learning*** from their mistakes and they can adapt to the new environment.
